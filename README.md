# autofillFR

## Purpose:

This project is meant to be a product that streamlines the process that hotels and guesthouses must do to enter the details of travellers on the appropriate website. The program is meant to take a photo of the traveller's passport and using OCR pick out the relevant details needed for the form. Then the program must make a post request to the appropriate webform with these details. 

## Issues:

1. I used googles open OCR and found it difficult to pick out the right details from different countries passports
2. The webform that I need to post to is behind a Captcha wall so that part can't be automated.
